## Announcements: 
   * Next Production Meeting Minutes will be recorded in Google Docs instead of Git. 
 
## Action/Significant Items:
   * USCMS Production expected to ramp up heavily in the near future. Premixing is nearly done and analysis will follow soon afterward. 
   * USATLAS reports stable production.
   * Multiple hiccups in the Production agenda being updated has made us look to alternatives. Next week Google Docs minutes will be tested. 
   * 22% of all FIFE jobs were executed on the OSG
   * MyOSG, Event and Blogs update this release cycle (Tuesday 8 August)

## Apologies: 
   * Kyle (Polar Hackathon)

## Atlas (Armen & Xin)
   * production status:
      * USATLAS total production over the past week was quite stable, at the average level of 60-70K running job slots. There was some drop in production level today, which looks like is a brokering issue and is under investigation. 
   * job statistics
      * OSG GRACC: 2.1M pilots, 13M walltime hours
      * ATLAS dashboard: 2.1M real jobs (18k on opportunistic resources)

## FIFE - FabrIc for Frontier Experiments (Tanya) 
   * 22% of all FIFE jobs were executed on the OSG
   * no major problems
   * nova 463K wall hours
   * darkside 87K wall hours
   * microboone 13K wall hours
   
## CMS (David)
   * CMS Utilization beginning to pick up -- high I/O pileup premixing workflows running at Wisconsin, Caltech, Nebraska & Florida -- once complete (optimistically late this week) expect to see large wave of CMS MC production jobs.
   * This past week: 9.73M Wall, 5.05M CPU, 236k jobs.

## Production Support (Ken)   
   * 128 M overall Wall hours in July; up from 125 M in June
      - ATLAS +3.6 M, HCC +1.7 M, CMS + 1.1M
      - OSG -2.3 M, FNAL -1 M
   * Thinking about ways to increase engagement with GPU reosurces after staff retreat and progress with Fermilab VO at SU
